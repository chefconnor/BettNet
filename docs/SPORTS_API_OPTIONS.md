## Recommendations for This Project:

1. **The Odds API** would be the best starting point:
   - Simpler integration
   - Focused on the odds data you need
   - More affordable for a portfolio project
   - Covers both NBA and NFL in one API
   - Includes enough bookmakers to detect line movement delays

2. **Simulation Strategy**:
   - Since these are not streaming APIs, the Spring Integration approach to simulate real-time data will be essential
   - Historical data can be collected over time to build a dataset for backtesting
   - Consider using a combined approach: live API calls for current games + historical saved data for training
